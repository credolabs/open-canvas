# Medication Safety Guidelines

## High-Alert Medications

### ISMP High-Alert Medication Classes
- **Anticoagulants** (warfarin, heparin, DOACs)
- **Insulin and oral hypoglycemics**
- **Opioids and narcotics**
- **Neuromuscular blocking agents**
- **Chemotherapy agents**
- **Concentrated electrolyte solutions**

### Look-Alike, Sound-Alike (LASA) Medications
- **Celebrex** ↔ **Celexa**
- **Xanax** ↔ **Zantac**
- **Prednisone** ↔ **Prednisolone**
- **Hydralazine** ↔ **Hydroxyzine**
- **Clonidine** ↔ **Clonazepam**

## Medication Reconciliation Process

### Admission Reconciliation
1. Obtain complete medication history from multiple sources
2. Include prescription, OTC, and herbal medications
3. Verify dosages, frequencies, and administration routes
4. Document allergies and adverse reactions
5. Identify and resolve discrepancies

### Transfer Reconciliation
- Review all medications for continued appropriateness
- Adjust for organ function changes
- Consider drug-drug interactions with new medications
- Update administration routes as needed

### Discharge Reconciliation
- Provide complete medication list with clear instructions
- Highlight medication changes from admission
- Include reasons for discontinuations
- Schedule appropriate follow-up monitoring

## Dosing Considerations

### Pediatric Dosing
- Weight-based calculations (mg/kg or mcg/kg)
- Body surface area calculations for chemotherapy
- Age-appropriate formulations
- Maximum dose limitations
- Developmental considerations for administration

### Geriatric Dosing
- **Start low, go slow** principle
- Consider reduced renal and hepatic function
- Review Beers Criteria for inappropriate medications
- Monitor for polypharmacy interactions
- Assess functional status and cognitive ability

### Renal Dosing Adjustments
- **CrCl >60 mL/min**: Usually no adjustment needed
- **CrCl 30-60 mL/min**: Moderate adjustment for some drugs
- **CrCl 15-30 mL/min**: Significant adjustments required
- **CrCl <15 mL/min**: Many drugs contraindicated

### Hepatic Dosing Adjustments
- **Child-Pugh Class A**: Mild impairment, minimal adjustment
- **Child-Pugh Class B**: Moderate impairment, dose reduction
- **Child-Pugh Class C**: Severe impairment, many drugs contraindicated

## Medication Administration Rights

### Traditional Five Rights
1. **Right Patient**: Two patient identifiers
2. **Right Drug**: Verify medication name and formulation
3. **Right Dose**: Calculate and verify dose accuracy
4. **Right Route**: Confirm appropriate administration route
5. **Right Time**: Administer within specified time window

### Additional Rights
6. **Right Documentation**: Complete, accurate recording
7. **Right Reason**: Appropriate indication for medication
8. **Right Response**: Monitor for therapeutic effect
9. **Right to Refuse**: Patient autonomy and education
10. **Right Assessment**: Pre-administration evaluation

## Special Populations

### Pregnancy Categories (Legacy System)
- **Category A**: Adequate studies show no risk
- **Category B**: Animal studies show no risk, no human studies
- **Category C**: Risk cannot be ruled out
- **Category D**: Positive evidence of risk, benefit may warrant use
- **Category X**: Contraindicated in pregnancy

### Modern Pregnancy Labeling
- **Pregnancy**: Risk summary and clinical considerations
- **Lactation**: Risk summary for breastfeeding
- **Females and Males of Reproductive Potential**: Fertility information

## Emergency Medications

### Code Blue Medications
- **Epinephrine**: 1mg IV every 3-5 minutes
- **Amiodarone**: 300mg IV bolus, then 150mg IV
- **Atropine**: 0.5-1mg IV for bradycardia
- **Sodium bicarbonate**: 1 mEq/kg IV for severe acidosis

### Anaphylaxis
- **Epinephrine**: 0.3-0.5mg IM (1:1000 solution)
- **Repeat**: Every 5-15 minutes as needed
- **Alternative routes**: IV (1:10,000 solution) if profound shock

## Quality Assurance

### Medication Error Prevention
- Double-check calculations independently
- Use barcode scanning when available
- Implement CPOE with clinical decision support
- Standardize concentrations and dosing protocols
- Provide adequate staffing and minimize interruptions

### Reporting and Analysis
- Report all medication errors and near misses
- Conduct root cause analysis for serious events
- Implement system-based solutions
- Share lessons learned across organization
- Monitor for trends and patterns

## Patient Education Points

### Before Discharge
- Purpose and expected effects of each medication
- Proper administration technique and timing
- Common side effects and when to call provider
- Drug interactions and food restrictions
- Storage requirements and expiration dates

### Ongoing Monitoring
- Signs and symptoms requiring immediate attention
- When and how to take missed doses
- Importance of adherence to prescribed regimen
- Regular follow-up appointments and lab monitoring
- When to contact healthcare provider
